##colorfox

Colorfox is a chrome extension which will change the way you read manga on the internet. ( assuming that you read manga, instead of just watching the anime ).

Its an evolutionarry backward app, suppose you currently waste x hours reading mangas per week, after this extension enters your life, you would be wasting like 2x - 3x hours per week. Cool right ?

###Features
+ Hide all the unnecessary elements of the page like ads, obvious navigations and instructions.
+ Allowing the user to add css-filters like sepia, color-invert, color-overlay to manga pages.                                                                            
+ Simple yet important things like viewing the manga progress by a progress bar and adding localstorage support to remember which page were you on last time you were reading.
+ Its awesome, and yes, that IS A FEATURE.
